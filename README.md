# syntrophic-SRB
This repository contains information for understanding the ecology, evolution and physiology of the syntrophic partnership that mediates
sulfate-coupled anaerobic oxidation of methane. This partnership is an obligate syntrophic association between anaerobic methanotrophic
archaea (ANME) and sulfate reducing bacteria. We aim to provide the following resources particularly to investigate the synytrophic SRB
partner of ANME:-

1. A curated database of metagenomes from known syntrophic SRB partners of ANME
2. HMMs for some proteins involved in extracellular electron transfer in the syntrophic SRB
3. Gene trees for proteins predicted to be important in the syntrophic SRB for partnership with anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME)
